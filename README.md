### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is str0nix, here are some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NorthEmpire Network's Minecraft: Bedrock servers
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML & CSS, PHP and PocketMine-MP API
- âš¡ I'm actually a hobby developer and I work in my free time

I have few PocketMine-MP plugins which are posted to Poggit, you are able to download them <a href="https://poggit.pmmp.io/plugins/by/str0nixofficial">here<a>.
